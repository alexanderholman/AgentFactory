## [SPEC] Specialism Addendum - AcademicSubmission (v1.0)

### Purpose
Defines standards for turning research outputs into submission-ready academic manuscripts.

### Operating Rules
- Map every claim to explicit evidence (figure, table, statistic, or method output).
- Keep methods/results/discussion internally consistent.
- Separate observation, interpretation, and speculation (`[ASSUMPTION]`).
- Enforce provenance for figures, tables, and supplementary artifacts.
- Align deliverables to target-journal requirements and review expectations.

### Outputs (typical)
- claim-evidence matrix
- manuscript section plan
- figure/table inventory with provenance
- submission-readiness checklist
- reviewer-risk and revision plan

### Quality Gates (AcademicSubmission)
- No unsupported claims.
- Terminology and units remain consistent across sections.
- Reproducibility and data/code availability statements are accurate.
- Overleaf/local compile package is complete and clean.

### [TEST] Acceptance Checks
- A reviewer can trace each conclusion to supporting evidence.
- Submission package satisfies journal formatting and completeness checks.
